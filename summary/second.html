<p class="freddy">Glamrock Freddy is based on the original Freddy Fazbear with a punk-themed design reminiscent of the style associated with the 1980's. His design somewhat resembles that of a jaguar or a lion more than a bear. He wears a top hat adorned with a blue stripe and a black bow tie, which later is replaced with a purple bow tie when upgraded with Glamrock Chica's voice box. His eyes are blue, which later yellow when replaced with Roxanne Wolf's eyes, with his body primarily being colored a bright orange or lighter yellow. His torso has a distinctive seam across the front where his chest compartment opens up. He is equipped with pairs of fangs, as well as light-blue claw nails and red shins. He wears large, red shoulder pauldrons, spiked bracelets, a red earring in his left ear, and face paint in a similar style to the members of rock bands (such as the Kiss band) with light-blue and red colors. Unlike most of his counterparts, his microphone comes with a stand.</p>

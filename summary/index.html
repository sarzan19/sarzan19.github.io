<p>Just like the other members of the Glamrocks, she is dressed in a 1970s vibe. She is a white-pink chicken with an orange beak, blue eyes, pink eyelids, long eyelashes, and orange feet. She has a few stray feathers that stick out from the top of her head with a pink hair bow, pink triangular marks on her cheeks, and pink eyeliner around her right eye. Just like her Toy & Funtime counterparts, Glamrock Chica's body is noticeably curvy, giving her the generic athletic build.</p>
